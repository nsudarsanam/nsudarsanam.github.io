I believe in the beauty of something not belonging. I believe in something being out of place. I believe that through the process of not belonging and in being out of place, people redefine what it means to call some place home. They put down roots, they change a place and a place changes with them.
I would like to learn how culture, food, music, language change when â€œoutsiders" come in. I would like to unravel the tangled web of stories that lie behind the deceptively simple facade of a place. That is what thoughtfox is dedicated to.
